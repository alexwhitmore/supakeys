title: Prerequisites
description: Before adding passkey authentication to your project, make sure you have the following requirements.
---

## Required

### Supabase Project

You need an active Supabase project. If you don't have one:

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Note your project URL and anon key

### Supabase CLI

The Supabase CLI is needed to run migrations and deploy edge functions:

```bash
# Install with npm (all platforms)
npm install -g supabase

# macOS with Homebrew
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# Windows with Scoop
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase

# Linux
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
# or download from https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases
```

Verify installation:

```bash
supabase --version
```

### Node.js

Node.js 18 or later is required:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
```

## HTTPS Requirement

WebAuthn requires a secure context. Your app must be served over HTTPS in production. For development:

- `localhost` works without HTTPS
- Local IP addresses require HTTPS
- Use a tool like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local HTTPS

## Browser Requirements

Users need a modern browser with WebAuthn support:

| Browser | Minimum Version |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Chrome  | 67+             |
| Firefox | 60+             |
| Safari  | 13+             |
| Edge    | 79+             |

You can check support programmatically:

```typescript
import { getPasskeySupport } from 'supakeys'

const support = await getPasskeySupport()
console.log(support.webauthn) // true if supported
```

## Recommended

### TypeScript

While not required, TypeScript is recommended for the best developer experience:

```bash
npm install -D typescript
```

### Local Supabase Setup

For development, consider running Supabase locally:

```bash
supabase init
supabase start
```

This gives you a local database and edge functions runtime for testing.
