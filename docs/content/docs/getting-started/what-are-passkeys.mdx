title: What are Passkeys?
description: Passkeys are a modern replacement for passwords, built on the WebAuthn standard developed by the FIDO Alliance and W3C. They provide a more secure and user-friendly way to authenticate.

## How Passkeys Work

Instead of typing a password, passkeys use public-key cryptography:

1. **Registration**: A unique key pair is created on your device. The private key never leaves your device. The public key is stored on the server.

2. **Authentication**: When you sign in, your device proves it has the private key by signing a challenge. No secret is ever transmitted over the network.

## Why Passkeys are Better

### Security Benefits

- **Phishing Resistant**: Passkeys are bound to specific domains. They can't be phished because they won't work on fake websites.
- **No Shared Secrets**: Unlike passwords, the private key never leaves your device. There's nothing to steal from a server breach.
- **No Password Reuse**: Each passkey is unique to each service.
- **Built-in 2FA**: Passkeys require both possession (your device) and verification (biometrics or PIN).

### User Experience Benefits

- **No Passwords to Remember**: Sign in with a fingerprint, face, or device PIN.
- **Faster Sign-in**: Authentication takes seconds, not the time to type a complex password.
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Passkeys sync across your devices via iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or other providers.
